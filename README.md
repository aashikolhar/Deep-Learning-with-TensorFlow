# 🧠Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow 

This repo contains approaches I implemented for a few of the most common problems that any Deep Learning Engineer starts with. 

📖It contains problems related to Computer vision, Natural language processing to have a hands on experience in building Deep neural networks using TensorFlow.

## Problems 
### 1.  Computer vision
- Cats vs Dogs classification😺🐶
- Food classification - pizza vs steak🍕🥩
- Food classification - 10 food classes

### 2. Natural Language Processing
- NLP - News Headlines  For Sarcasm Detection
- NLP -  Disaster Tweets
